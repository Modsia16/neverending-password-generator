##Starting off looking up given code

Not seeing a ton on associaton with given code. Need to study and practice.

create checkboxes and adjust a few css styles for now unless more time to customise is permitted

finding various instruction to create password generators
current markup for var doesnt make sense to me (study more) 
    associat with let
    let values

study further how to generate password.
use random math calculation kind of like rock paper scissors math
